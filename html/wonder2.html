        Over 2000 years ago, Greek travelers compiled a list of the most incredible marvels <br>
         they encountered, which would become famously known as The Seven Ancient Wonders of the <br>
          World. However, with the Pyramids of Giza being the only original survivor, a Swiss <br>
           organization decided to take matters into its own hands and update the list. In 2001, <br>
            New7Wonders Foundation asked the public which places they thought were the world’s biggest  <br>
            wonders. After more than 100 million votes and deliberation between 200 potential candidates, <br>
            <span style=" margin-bottom: 30px;">these seven became the victors.</span>  <br>

        <div style="margin-LEFT: 300px ; margin-top: 20PX; margin-bottom: 30px;">     In Northern China, the Great Wall of China is one of the largest construction projects <br>
               recorded in human history. Despite popular belief, the Great Wall cannot be seen by the naked eye from <br>
                outer space. While estimates of its length vary, China’s National Administration of Cultural <br>
                Heritage reports the wall to be an impressive 13,170 miles (21,195 kilometers) long. Walking <br>
                 the entire wall nonstop would take approximately 17 months! Some work on the wall dates back to <br>
                  the 7th century BCE, although the Ming Dynasty constructed the principal, most well-preserved <br>
                   parts between 1368 and 1644. Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall of China is not a <br>
                    singular, connected wall. It actually consists of numerous walls, some parallel for stretches,<br>
                     accompanied by watch towers and platforms. China built the Great Wall to better protect its <br>
                      northern border, although its effectiveness is debated. The Great Wall has been a UNESCO <br>
                       World Heritage site since 1987. Today, over 10 million tourists visit the wall every year. Visitors <br>
                        can easily access it from Beijing.</div>

                          Situated in Yucatan, Mexico, Chichén Itzá was a city built by the Mayan people. The first <br>
                           settlements in the city began in approximately 435-600 CE, while the city would become <br>
                            abandoned hundreds of years later in 1250 CE. The Mayan tribe, Itzá, was responsible for many <br>
                             of the structures built in this city. The most well-known pyramid in Chichén Itza is El Castillo, a <br>
                              four-sided pyramid that is 185 feet (55.5 meters) wide and 78 feet (24 meters) tall. Impressively, <br>
                               the pyramid has 365 steps, each step representing a day of the year. During the spring and fall <br>
                                equinoxes, a shadow forms on the temple’s north stairway, creating the illusion of a slithering <br>
                                 serpent. Today, 26 ruins still stand in Chichén Itzá, and approximately 2.5 million people visit the <br>
                                  site every year. Most visitors travel from Cancun or the Rivera Maya to see Chichén Itzá.

                        Petra, Jordan, is an ancient city whose buildings are carved into pink, red, and white sandstone <br>
                         cliffs. It is one of the oldest existing cities in the world and stretches over 100 square miles (259 <br>
                          square kilometers). The Nabateans founded it in approximately the fourth century, chiseling <br>
                           temples, dwellings, and tombs in the stone. The Nabateans also had very advanced <br>
                            infrastructure, creating an impressive irrigation system of dams, canals, and reservoirs that <br>
                             provided water for over 30,000 participants in the otherwise arid zone. Some remnants of this <br>
                              irrigation system are still visible today. Visitors may recognize the ancient city from Indiana <br>
                               Jones and The Last Crusade, which filmed several scenes there. Petra became a UNESCO <br>
                                World Heritage site in 1985, and currently, around 900,000 people visit it annually.

                          Machu Picchu is an Incan ancient ruins site located in the Andes Mountains, near the city of <br>
                           Cusco, Peru. Built in approximately 1450 CE, the Incans used very impressive drystone <br>
                            techniques, snuggly fitting together jagged stones like jigsaw pieces. Thanks to this intricate <br>
                             building technique, many of the structures continue to stand to this day. Peruvian farmer Agustín <br>
                              Lizárraga was the first recorded individual to discover Machu Picchu in 1902. However, Herman <br>
                               Bingham brought it to the attention of the Western world in 1911 with his discovery of it. There <br>
                                are many theories about the reasons for Machu Picchu’s construction. Some scholars believe <br>
                                 that Machu Picchu was a holy convent known as “Virgins of the Sun” for women who were <br>
                                  dedicated to the Incan sun god, Inti. Other theories include the city being a royal retreat for the <br>
                                   Emporer Pachacuti or being a trading hub or location to test new crops. In 1983, Machu Picchu <br>
                                    became a UNESCO World Heritage site, and today, approximately 1.5 million people visit it each year.

                          Located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Christ the Redeemer is a massive, 98-foot (30-meter) tall <br>
                           statue made of concrete and soapstone. It is the youngest of the New Seven Wonders of the <br>
                            World. Princess Isabel introduced the concept when she requested that an image of Jesus <br>
                             Christ be erected in 1888, honoring Brazil's abolition of slavery. The Roman Catholic <br>
                              archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro re-proposed the idea in 1921, receiving approval from President <br>
                               Epitácio Pessoa shortly after. It opened to the public ten years later, in 1931. Around 2 million <br>
                                people visit the site every year.
